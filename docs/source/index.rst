Welcome to mol_translator's documentation!
==========================================

**mol_translator** is a python library for processing chemical data files (sdf, mol2, xyz, etc...) into different formats. Its main usage is in the generation of
gaussian/orca DFT calculation files. It utilises both `openbabel <http://openbabel.org/wiki/Main_Page>`_ and `rdkit <https://www.rdkit.org>`_ and combines it into a user
friendly API.

Check out the :doc:`install` section for install instructions.
